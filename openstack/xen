Memory Sharing
allow sharing of identical pages between HVM guests.
Xen's memory sharing mechanism, called the grant mechanism, is used to share I/O buffers in guest domains' memory with a driver domain.
Previous studies have identified the grant mechanism as a significant source of network I/O overhead in Xen.


Memory Paging
allow pages belonging to HVM guests to be paged to disk

Cpupool
advanced partitioning
